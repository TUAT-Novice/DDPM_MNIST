# DDPM_MNIST

This is the simple implementation of conditional diffusion model (ddpm, ddim) for MNIST dataset. Most codes are modified from another repository [https://github.com/tatakai1/classifier_free_ddim/tree/main](https://github.com/tatakai1/classifier_free_ddim/tree/main). Please check more details from the link if necessary.
